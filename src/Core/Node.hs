{- | Node type
 Note that the concept of a `Node` here is different from "node" in jbeam, when I mention JBeam nodes in this document I will explicitly call them JBeam nodes or call them Vertices.
In this document when I refer to nodes I mean a datatype I which I have created to represent arrays, objects and scalar inside a JBeam structure.
type declares a type synomom for a already existing type while data declares a new type.
So a Node can be:
- a Array and contain a vector of Nodes
- a Object and contain a vector of Nodes
- a ObjectKey and contain a 2-element tuple (also called a pair) where the the first element is the key and the second is the value
- a String which contains a Text
- a Number which contains a Scientific, a numeric data type which I really like to due to it unlike most other types in many programming languages can express any arbitrary-precision decimal number without rounding errors or losing precision.
- a Bool which contains either True or False
- a MultilineComment or SinglelineComment which contains a Text
- a Null meaning that the node is empty

So in fact Node is a recursive data structure, a type which references itself.
Text is yet a another string type in Haskell which is good fit when doing appends or comparisons which I tend to do quite a lot in this codebase.
I comptemplated using something like [OMap](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ordered-containers-0.2.4/docs/Data-Map-Ordered.html) for the Object but then I realized that I do not only need support pairs of keys and values for the Object case, I also need to support the Object having Comments as direct children.
The parser is currently written using attoaparsec but I are considering to migrate to Megaparsec since Megaparsec has better support implementing error messages which can be given to the end user.
