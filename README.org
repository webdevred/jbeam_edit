* JBeam Tool in Haskell
A Parser, Formatter, and Editor for jbeam Files

This project is a command-line tool designed to work with jbeam files (the structured, JSON-like format used in BeamNG to define vehicles, physics, and structures). Initially implemented in Haskell as a fast and robust demo, it has grown into a comprehensive utility for manipulating jbeam data.

** Features

*** Complete File Parsing
- Parses entire =.jbeam= files, including comments.
- Ignores irrelevant whitespace.
- Handles both clean and manually edited files without breaking.

*** Consistent Formatting
- Reformats the entire file with uniform indentation, spacing, and layout.
- Improves readability and maintainability of JBeam data.

*** Automatic Node Management
- Sorts and sequentially renames all nodes (e.g., =["bf1", ...]= becomes =["bf0", "bf1", "bf2"]=).
- Updates all references to renamed nodes throughout the file to prevent inconsistencies.

*** Configurable Formatting Rules — Powered by JBFL
=jbeam_edit= supports user-defined rule files in JBFL (JBeam Formatting Language), a declarative mini-language for specifying formatting behavior.

**** Example rule file (rules.jbfl)

#+BEGIN_SRC jbfl
.*.nodes[*][*] {
    PadZeros: false;
    PadAmount: 8;
    PadDecimals: 3;
}

.*.flexbodies[*] {
    NoComplexNewLine: true;
}
#+END_SRC

**** Capabilities of JBFL
- Target specific parts of the data tree using wildcard patterns.
- Control indentation, spacing, padding, and decimal precision.
- As a maintainer, enforce customized formatting rules to fit your preference.

** Planned Features / TODO

- Detect support vertices (nodes with a high number of beam connections) and group them automatically.
- Handle cases where meta nodes (e.g., ={"group":"..."}=) interrupt node groups.
- Allow prefix replacement via command-line arguments (e.g., replace ="bf"= in nodes, beams, triangles, and flexbodies).
- Introduce =PadDecimals= setting to control numeric precision rather than just padding length.
- Expand test coverage.
- Add dedicated, curated example files to demonstrate typical workflows and tool capabilities.
  (Currently available example =.jbeam= files come from a collaborator's real mod and serve as examples until we produce example files dedicated for the project.)
- Improve documentation to support new contributors and clarify configuration use.

** Why Haskell + Megaparsec

- Rapid Prototyping & Robustness - Haskell’s strong type system and expressive syntax allowed for quick development of a reliable prototype.
- Elegant Parser Composition - Utilizing the Parsec family of parser combinators enabled building modular, reusable components that make the parser clear and maintainable.
- Safe Data Transformation - Haskell’s emphasis on immutability and pure functions ensures that even complex transformations of your jbeam files are performed safely and predictably.

** Future Considerations

I have considered porting this project to C/C++ in the future.

*** Ease of Distribution for Windows Users
  Many developers running Windows already have Visual Studio and MSVC installed, so a C/C++ version might simplify the build process by eliminating the need for additional toolchains (like GHC).

*** Trade-Offs
  Although a C/C++ rewrite might improve accessibility on Windows, it would come at the expense of Haskell’s expressive power, type safety, and the elegant parser composition facilitated by Parsec.

For now, the project remains a Haskell-based tool, but the idea of a C/C++ port is kept in mind as it might broaden the user base in the future.

** Getting Started

*** Prerequisites

- Haskell Compiler: GHC (https://www.haskell.org/ghc/)  
- Build Tool: Stack (https://docs.haskellstack.org)

*** Installation

Clone the repository and build the project using your preferred Haskell build tool:

git clone https://github.com/webdevred/jbeam-tool.git  
cd jbeam-tool  
stack build

*** Usage

Run the tool from the command line as follows:

#+begin_src 
stack exec jbeam-tool -- [options] <input-file>
#+end_src

The tool will:

- Parse the provided jbeam file.  
- Format it according to the default or user-defined rules.  
- Automatically sort nodes, rename them sequentially, and update all related references.
